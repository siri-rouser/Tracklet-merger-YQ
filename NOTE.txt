Based on my own impression, commit ac53f11917ad4f7798138c3000baa9ec7c132f52 is the workable version of 'real-time' tracklet-merge, which refers to 2018 paper. 
Now(31/07/2025), I am working on another version of MCVT framework.

On (12/08/2025), I am working on this package again on branch main, the aim is achieve the final MCVT:
 Workpage 1: Local SCT rematch
 Workpage 2: MCVT (Greedy Match)
